# Bank-Loan-Analysis---Tableau
The complete process of building a data analysis project using popular tools such as Tableau and sql. This project involves the use of Tableau and SQL for data analysis and visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from a dataset and present them in a visually appealing and understandable manner.

## Project Overview

The project begins with data extraction using SQL, a powerful language for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. The extracted data is then analyzed and visualized using Tableau, a leading tool in the field of data visualization. The final output is a comprehensive dashboard or set of visualizations that provide valuable insights into the dataset.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Extraction**: The first step involves extracting the necessary data from an SQL database. This could involve complex queries to filter, sort, and aggregate the data as needed[4].

2. **Data Analysis**: Once the data is extracted, it is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. This could involve statistical analysis, data cleaning, and data transformation.

3. **Data Visualization**: The analyzed data is then visualized using Tableau. This could involve creating various types of charts, graphs, and maps to represent the data in a visually appealing and understandable manner[5].

4. **Interpretation of Results**: The final step involves interpreting the results of the data visualization. This could involve explaining the insights gained from the data and how they could be used for decision-making[4].

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: Used for data extraction and manipulation. SQL is a standard language for managing data held in a relational database management system.

- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization. Tableau is a powerful tool that allows you to create interactive dashboards and reports.

## Project Outcome

The outcome of this project is a comprehensive data analysis report with visualizations that provide valuable insights into the dataset. The report will be easy to understand and will allow decision-makers to make informed decisions based on the insights gained from the data.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL for data extraction and manipulation, and Tableau for data visualization. It also demonstrates the ability to interpret and communicate the results of a data analysis in a clear and understandable manner.
